# Scoping Note:  SALTO Project 

## Main Objective: 

In order to improve its offer and its customer knowledge, SALTO wishes to analyze the feelings of the tweets to its attention. And thus extract the polarity (positive, negative, neutral), irritants and strengths of its offer. At the same time, SALTO wants to detect the programs that generate the most tweets and follow them over time according to the marketing and acquisition actions implemented.  


## Secondary objectives (depending on time and difficulties encountered):  

Detect future nuggets (programs) in order to improve our content acquisition strategy. As such, the objective here is at the global level (not just the tweets to SALTO) to detect programs that generate interest. 

Detect user communities around a content (e.g. Les Marseillais fans) in order to isolate and address them (marketing and acquisition actions)  

## Our mission:  

- Prerequisite: Access to the Twitter API 
- Retrieve tweets for SALTO (mention "@SALTO_en") 
- At least, the content of the tweet and the date (for changes over time) 

## Preprocessing of data 

- Classification of tweets (positive, negative, neutral) 
- Visualization of the results (Dashboard)

- e.g.: evolution of the number of negative and positive tweets per month 
- e.g.: Top most quoted programs  
- e.g.: Top strong points and irritants 

## Support and technical stack: 

- A Google Cloud Platform project dedicated to students  
- A shared drive (for documentation and notebook)
